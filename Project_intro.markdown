# Babydoom - A data analysis of the Danish birth rate
Every day in the media we hear about the declining birth rate in Denmark. In this project we will investigate the reasons behind this trend. We will look at the data and try to find out if there are any patterns or correlations that can explain the declining birth rate. We will also look at the consequences of the declining birth rate and discuss what can be done to reverse the trend.

## Data
The data we will use in this project is from Statistics Denmark. We will use data from the last 17 years to see if we can find any patterns or correlations that can explain the declining birth rate. The data includes age of the mother, area of residence and year.

One of the points we hear often is that women wait too long to have children. We have made an interactive plot, where you can see the number of births for each age group - where the year can be changed. This plot can be seen below.

When looking at the data we can see that women in the 2000's are younger than now. This is also shown in the plot below, where we have calculated the mean age of the mothers for each year. The plot shows that the mean age of the mothers has increased over the years.
