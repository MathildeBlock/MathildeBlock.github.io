## Babydoom
Every day in the media we hear about the declining birth rate in Denmark. In this project we will investigate the reasons behind this trend. We will look at the data and try to find out if there are any patterns or correlations that can explain the declining birth rate. We will also look at the consequences of the declining birth rate and discuss what can be done to reverse the trend.

# Data
The data we will use in this project is from Statistics Denmark. We will use data from the last 17 years to see if we can find any patterns or correlations that can explain the declining birth rate. The data includes age of the mother, area of residence and year.

# How bad is it really?
For a start let's look at the number of births in Denmark over the last 17 years. To see how bad it really is, we have made a plot showing the total number of births for each year. The plot can be seen below. Notice that the plot is zoomed in on the y-axis to make it easier to see the differences between the years.

From the plot we can see that the number of births fluctuate over the years, and we see the least amount of births in 2013. We found this interesting, since we didn't expect it. We found that a likely explanation for this drop in 2012, 2013 and 2014 is that there were less women born in the 80's, which is the age group that has the most children.

Another explanation is that financial conditions for families were worsened by political regulations.

We also see a slight increase in the number of births in 2021, which we expect is due to the corona pandemic. The decrease in births in 2009 we suspect are from the financial crisis.
We choose to fit a line to the data to see the trend over the years. We see that the trend is declining, which is what we expected if we look at the headlines in the media.


To further investigate we wanted to see if the pattern where the same for all parts of Denmark, so we made a plot showing the number of births for each region. The plot can be seen below.

Here we see that ....


Since people move between regions it is hard to be certain that we see the truths from the plot.

We wanted to investigate if women in different municipality.

# Age of the mothers
Another aspect we wanted to investigate was the age of the mothers. As one of the arguments we hear often is that women wait too long to have children, which makes it harder to get pregnant naturally. We have made an interactive plot, where you can see the number of births for each age group - where the year can be changed. This plot can be seen below.

When looking at the data we can see that women in the 2000's generally are younger than now. We also see that in the start of the 2010's women around 30 had less children than other years, this might be because there are less women born in the 80's. 

This is also shown in the plot below, where we have calculated the mean age of the mothers for each year. The plot shows that the mean age of the mothers has increased over the years. The problem with this is that the older the mother is, the harder it is to get pregnant naturally. This might be one of the reasons why the birth rate is declining.
